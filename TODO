* GPS position daemon
  - Collect GSM locations
    + Keep updated about GPS but do not force it to be on (depend on other logics or user to force it on)
    + Every ten seconds check GPS status and if has fix, get GSM cell data and log it for cellhunter
    - Smart recording of new cells and new locations around existing cells
    - When detecting that there is network access
      - Upload cellhunter data
  - Position service
    - Import
      - from cellhunter
      - from openbmap
      - from opencellid
    - Calculate
      - Based on cell tower position
        - Average of cell locations
        - Weighted average of cell locations
        - Smart propogation model
      - Based on cell samples
        - Intersection of boundary of cell detections
          # Calculate a boundary polygon for the reception of a cell
          # Calculate the intersection of all relevant boundaries
        	# Find the center of the intersected polygon, give as solution
